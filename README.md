# RKin_Dyn
Kinematics and Dynamics of a Robot

In fk.py, first you will be asked to enter the number of links of a robot.
After entering the number of links you will be asked to enter the values of D-H parameter.
First enter the value of link length (a) for each link.
Second enter the value of alpha in degree for each link.
Third enter the value of link offset (d) for each link.
Fourth enter the value of theta in degree for each link.
Then you will get the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix.

Later I'll add Inverse Kinematics and Dynamics too.
Thank You
